# Real_Time_Face_Mask_Detection
### Real time facemask detection using yolov5 which is able to detect No-Mask, Improper-Mask and Mask.
- Implementation of System to Detect Face Mask
- Detecting Using Real-Time and Video Feed from the system
- Based on the Yolo5 Object Detection Algorithm
- YOLO: You Only Look Once Version 5
- Able to detect a person wearing a mask or not and also improper wearing

## How to Run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- To start web server run Main.py file:
``` 
python Main.py
```
- To run only detection use detect_face_mask.py
```
python detect_face_mask.py
```
